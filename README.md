cakephp-viewautoload
====================

Load .js files with views automatically!

## Loading view-related .js files ##
This plugin lets you create corresponding .js files for your views and include 
them automatically in the body (the 'script' block) of the current page:

**directory structure**
 * app
 ** View
 *** Article
 **** view.ctp
 **** view.js
 **** basic.js

**controller code**
class ArticleController extends AppController {
    public $components = array(
        'ViewAutoload.JsAutoload'
    )
    
    public function view($id){
        $this->set('article', $this->Article->read(null, $id));
    }
}

**view.ctp**
<h1><?php echo $article['Atricle']['title'] ?></h1>

**view.js**
alert("You are about to read something amazing.");

**layout.ctp
$this->fetch('script'); //fetches the script block, where the view.js is included



##advantages##

* Easy setup - just define the component, write the {view_name}.js file and enjoy.
* Ease of maintenance - each view has it's corresponding .js next to it in the views folder, making development easier and organized.
* Code safety - the code is included into the page, rather than linked to it from a webroot file, which is great if you do not wish to publicly reveal the structure of your app to nosey people (i.e. admin pages)
* Dynamic js files - you can use PHP within your .js file and access the current viewVars for the currently rendered view.
* Light - you can attach the component only for controllers which use it, stop automatic view detection and load one or multiple .js files manually from the controller action.

##disadvantages##

* Not-entirely conventional - .js files are not really supposed to be in the View folder, but it makes sense to me to put them there for small pieces of view-related code.
* Size and Caching - if you have big .js files and need them to be cached, you should link to a .js file from the webroot and not include it in the page.

##Options##
The JsAutoload component takes 3 options in the settings array:
* 'block' ('script') - which view block should the file be written to
* 'eval' (false) - setting eval to true will parse any PHP your .js file has and pass the set viewVars to it
* 'auto' (true) - if auto is false, you need to load the js manually, as the component will not check if the .js file exists.

Each of these settings can be overriden in the JsAutoload::loadFile options array.
